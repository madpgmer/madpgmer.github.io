# Migrating from MariaDB to MongoDB

Howdy!
<br>
<div align="justify">
In my previous post we talked about MongoDB’s growing popularity and its compatibility with other databases with regards to business intelligence and scalability. I also wrote about how documents in a collection need not be well defined or structured and demonstrated some CRUD operations using Mongo Shell through my video.</div>

> Let me take this topic further and talk about migrating from an RDBMS to NoSQL, especially MongoDB. 

<div align="justify">
Data partitioning and data replication are the major features that set NoSQL apart from conventional RDBMS. Despite these advantages, most big and medium-sized software systems currently in use are still RDBMS-based since the migration process is fraught with difficulties. The first is the amount of data that needs to be moved. Organizations typically decide to move their databases when the amount of data being stored is enormous and the RDBMS can no longer meet the demands for high availability and scalability. The way the relational database architecture avoids data redundancy, which is a feature of the NoSQL models, presents another obstacle.</div>
<br>
<div align="justify">
The original data model must remain semantically identical to the new data model in this case. Therefore, without any data loss or modification, all current relationships must be precisely recorded (Normalize). In addition to the expense of transferring all the data and models, there is also a cost associated with upgrading software’s so they can successfully connect with the new MongoDB database.  </div>
 <br>
<div align="justify">
Whether the target and source databases are of the same kind or not, migration involves moving the source database's entire contents, including its structures and data, to the target database. In my situation, switching from MariaDB to MongoDB is a difficult undertaking. The procedure of retrieving data is greatly complicated by the necessity of changing the application source code to conform to the new database. </div>
<br>
<div align="justify">
For this blog post I wanted to convert one of my Maven web applications projects that was connected to MariaDB to MongoDB and demo it to my readers. I succeeded in converting the database (converting tables to collections and maintaining some key values that had relationships with other collections) but when it came to creating models and controllers to access the data, everything went for a toss!! </div>
    
> Until you are successfully connecting to your new database and doing certain operations with it, its not considered a successful migration!!
  
  
<div align="justify">  
I was very confident about writing queries and manipulating the data but for some reason even my Netbeans debugger could not properly identify the connection issue. After umpteen number of coffees and stack overflow searches, I gave up! </div>

One of the main reasons to give up was also related to not having enough time on my hand. This semester has been one <i>helluva</i> time crusher with a zillion deliverable. I have promised myself to give this web app a go sometime in September so for now I’m going to migrate a simple SQL database to MongoDB hosted in my cluster on Atlas and write a java program to do some CRUD operations. I will use my favorite Eclipse to do the deed! </div>
 <br>
  <div align="justify">
To demonstrate this Migration process, I will use a java program we (Jenny and I) wrote during our second semester java course. Below is a quick video on how the application compiles and generates data we request from a Movie SQL database (Movies!! Now you know why I picked this application!</div>

  <div align="justify">
Two of MongoDB's primary architectural objectives are developer productivity and ease of usage.
The MongoDB interface is implemented as methods (or functions) within the API of a particular programming language, as opposed to a wholly distinct text-based language like SQL, which is a key distinction between a SQL-based RDBMS and MongoDB. This makes application integration simple, as does the similarity between the BSON document model used by MongoDB and the data structures used in object-oriented programming.</div>
<br>
  <div align="justify">
MongoDb has idiomatic drivers for most of the popular languages including Java and a lot of community supported drivers. This offering minimizes onboarding time for new developers like me and simplifies application development. For those who are familiar with SQL, it is useful to understand how core SQL statements such as CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE map to the MongoDB API. [1] The documentation includes a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/sql-comparison/">comparison chart</a> with examples to assist in the transition to MongoDB Query Language structure and semantics. In addition, MongoDB offers an extensive array of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/">advanced query operators</a></div>

There are numerous ways for project teams to import data from current relational databases into MongoDB. The project's stage and the environment at their disposal should determine the tool to use. Many users write their own scripts that convert source data into a hierarchical JSON structure so that it may be imported into MongoDB with the help of the mongo import tool.</div>

<p align="center">Few options of migrating data </p> 
 <div align="justify">	
Many migrations require incrementally transferring production data while operating the current RDBMS in parallel with the new MongoDB database </div>

- The program publishes records back into MongoDB using the needed document structure as they are fetched from the RDBMS.

- Only MongoDB is used to store any newly created or changed data. 
<br>
  <div align="justify">	
When implementing new application features with MongoDB or when several apps are running on the legacy RDBMS, incremental migration can be used. Teams can divide projects into more manageable and agile development sprints by simply migrating the applications that are being upgraded. While limiting service availability interruption, incremental migration also offers a fallback alternative in case it becomes necessary to return to the legacy database. </div>

> To execute parallel processes, develop applications, or conduct load testing, many businesses create feeds from their source systems, wherein they dump daily changes from an existing RDBMS into MongoDB. 
<br>
  <div align="justify">	
Making "A" and "B" target databases in MongoDB and switching their daily feeds between them is one approach solve the problem. In this case, Database A only receives one daily feed before the program switches to Database B to receive feeds on the next day. When fresh feeds are made to Database A, a whole new instance of the source database is generated, ensuring that deletions are synchronized with the source data. In the meantime, the existing Database A is deleted.</div>
