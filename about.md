### More Information

<div align="justify">
I've always enjoyed messing around with tech but I had never really thought that programming was going to be right for me. You always hear that you need to be extremely smart and you need to be good at math etc.. so I always ruled that out as a possibility and when I even decided to start looking for courses in tech I thought about going into computer systems and networking because i didn't think that I was cut out for programming. Today, I'm so glad that I did not let those thoughts overpower me. The last two years has been exiting and now I can say that I'm passionate about coding. I have had a strong background working with clients and in-house developers to identify requirements, assist with creating user interfaces and develop implementation timelines etc, but now, I possess and in-depth understanding of project lifecycle, including all phases of system and software development. This is the last semester so exited to see whats in store for me in the coming months. </div>

This blog, although a course requirement, feels like will end up being a hub to document my journey in this newly discovered world of software development. 

Keep watching this space!!
