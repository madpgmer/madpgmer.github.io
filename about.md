IT- Software Development student at SAIT School for Advanced Digital Technology (SADT) graduating in 2022.

### More Information

<div align="justify">
I've always enjoyed messing around with code, be it PeopleCode, Python, JavaScripts, or troubleshooting small tech issues at work. Im an Autodedact, learnt from Udemy, YouTube universities. Although my work has always been in a Retail/Distribution domain here in Canada, I was fortunate enough to have my managers trust me with their in-house systems. Be it fixing POS issues, updating employee scheduler program, or vehicle management softwares in the supply chain section, I have done it all. When covid hit and I got laid off , I took to upskill myself and make a career change, hence I enrolled myself to a proper promising Diploma in Software Dev at SAIT. The last two years have been exciting and my passion about coding has only increased. I have had a strong background working with clients and in-house developers to identify requirements, assist with creating user interfaces and develop implementation timelines etc, but now, I possess an in-depth understanding of project lifecycle, including all phases of system and software development. This is the last semester, so excited to see what's in store for me in the coming months. </div>

This blog, although a course requirement, feels like will end up being a hub to document my journey in this newly discovered world of software development. 

Keep watching this space!!
